This file will provide an overview of the directory structure and files used by BNW.

At this point, BNW requires two packages that are not currently included in the BNW directory.
These are Octave and dot/graphviz. The BNW code assumes:
a) dot can be executed using /usr/bin/dot
b) octave can be executed using /usr/bin/octave

BNW is currently located at /var/www/html/compbio/BNW_x.xx
(The current development version is BNW_1.12).

The main directory contains two basic files (index.html and home.php) and two directories.
home.php can be modified/updated to use other versions of BNW

downloads: This contains the downloadable version of the BNW structure learning package.

sourcecodes: This contains the files and codes that are used by the webserver.
The main purpose of this file is to provide an overview of the files that are contained in 'sourcecodes'.

1. Directories within sourcecodes:
a) bnt-master: This contains the code for Bayes Net Toolbox which is used in parameter learning in BNW.
	It has been slightly modified from its original version to work with Octave instead of MATLAB.

b) parameter_learning: This contains the MATLAB/Octave code that we have written for parameter_learning.
        It also prepares data that has been uploaded to BNW so it can be used with the structure learning code.

c) k-best and localscore: These two directories contain the sourcecode used for structure learning.

d) BNW_workflow_test_files, example_datasets, and examples: These three directories contain files that are used by the tutorials and examples on the BNW homepage.

e) data: The data for files generated by using BNW is written to this directory. It also contains several sub-directories that contain example data and networks.


2. Files within sourcecodes:
a) Major BNW php files:
Many of these will be described in more detail in another file that I am working on.
bn_file_load_gom.php: Used in uploading data to be used for structure learning.
create_tiers_gom.php: Structural constraint interface.
home_upload.php: Used in uploading a data file and a structure file when the structure is known. 
layout_example.php: Main php file for displaying/making predictions with network using example data.
layout.php: Main php file for displaying a network and using it to make predictions.
net_structure.php: Used in uploading the structure file when the network structure is known.
upload_structure_file.php: Used in uploading the structure file when the network structure is known.
The following are self-explanatory:
faq.php
getting_started.php
help.php
home.php
workflow.php

b) Files related to the structure learning package:
build.sh
network_score
structure

c) Files related to home page, help files, example data sets, and tutorials:
BNW_overview.png
BNW_workflow_1.htm
BNW_workflow_2.htm
BNW_workflow_net1.htm
BNW_workflow_sci.htm
index.html
example.php
examplefilecopy.sh

d) General html/css/inc files:
header_batchsearch.inc
header_new.inc
js-graph-it.css
js-graph-it.js
my_new_style.css
sf-homepage.css

e) PHP files that support layout.php or layout_example.php:
I will describe these further in another file.
add_evd_example.php
add_evd.php
add_inv_example.php
add_inv.php
network_layout_evd_2_example.php
network_layout_evd_2.php
network_layout_evd_2xample.php
network_layout_evd.php
network_layout_inv_2_example.php
network_layout_inv_2.php
network_layout_inv_example.php
network_layout_inv.php

f) Scripts used in structure and parameter learning:
run_octave: perform parameter learning with original data set and no evidence or intervention
run_octave_evd: perform parameter learning when considering evidence
run_octave_inv: perform parameter learning when considering intervention
run_prep_input: perform prepare data uploaded to BNW for use with structure/parameter learning packages
run.sh: perform structure learning

g) Files that perform specific functions:
tier_description_processing_gom.php
-Used by create_tiers_gom.php for the structure constraint interface.

clear_example.php, clear.php, and filecopy.sh
-Used by layout.php to clear entered evidence/intervention 

execute_bn_gom.php
-Runs the script (run.sh) that performs structure learning after uploading data/adding constraints
-It is actually called by executionprogress.php

executionprogress.php, runtime_check.php, k_only_table.txt, and maxparent_table.txt
-Used to provide an estimate of how long structure learning will take.

graphviz_structure.php
-Called by net_structure.php and used to generate files when users upload data with a known structure.

mat_structure.php
-Called by add_inv.php and add_inv_example.php when making predictions after an intervention.
-Interventions can change the network structure and this file helps account for these changes.

matrix.php
-Allows for viewing the structure matrix file.

input_check.php
-Allows for viewing the input file and variable description file after it is uploaded.

parameter_display.php
-Allows for viewing the network parameters of the original data set and after entering evidence/intervention.
