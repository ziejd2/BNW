# BNW

This contains the code for the Bayesian Network Webserver (BNW).

The master branch will be the stable version of the code for running with GeneNetwork. The original BNW website is compbio.uthsc.edu/BNW, which currently redirects to BNW_1.3.

There are a couple of files in the info_files directory that provide descriptions of the BNW code and other information.

There are five branches.
1) master: This is the version of BNW that should be loaded to GeneNetwork. Right now, it should be identical to the genenet6_final_1.3 branch.

2) matlab_original (compbio.uthsc.edu/BNW_1.01): This is functionally identical to the original BNW code. The only difference is that unused files were removed.

3) octave_version (compbio.uthsc.edu/BNW_1.02): This should perform similarly to the original version of BNW. However, instead of Matlab, Octave is used and a couple of new features were added.

4) genenet6_final_1.3: This is the final version of BNW on the GENENET6 server.

5) genenet8_initial_1.3: This is the working version of BNW on GENENET8 when we transitioned to that server.
