This file will contain notes about changes that might need to be made on a new server:

Required software:
1) Octave
   BNW assumes Octave can be executed using /usr/bin/octave
   
2) dot/graphviz
   BNW assumes the graphviz command dot can be executed using /usr/bin/dot
   
3) plotly
   I installed a local copy of python in my home directory to run plotly on the old server, so there are a couple of lines that point to 
     this python/plotly.
   

Specific changes that need to be made:
1) Files that use Octave:
Header lines in all of the files in the run_scripts directory

2) Files that use dot:
-network_layout_evd_2_example.php: line 275
-network_layout_evd_2.php: line 247
-network_layout_inv_2_example.php: line 360
-network_layout_inv_2.php: line 360
-network_layout_inv.php: line 102
-network_layout_inv_example.php: line 150
-network_layout_evd.php: line 114
-network_layout_evd_example.php: line 117

3) Files that use plotly:
cv_plotly.ph: header line
ts_plotly.py: header line
kfold_plotly.ph: header line

4) Other changes:
home.php might need to be modified
The structure learning package might need to be recompiled. If so, running build.sh in the sourcecodes directory will hopefully work. It uses gcc
