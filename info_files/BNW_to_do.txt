This file needs to be updated, but most of the basic ideas are still true.

1) Improve cross-validation and prediction interface and output. The development version has three specific tools here:
leave-one-out cross validation, k-fold cross validation, and making predictions using a test data set.
a) There might be a couple of additional metrics for assessing the quality of predictions that we could add. I will look at some the Bayesian network R packages again to see what they use.
b) A hold-out validation options could also potentially be added.

2) Add informative error messages for when things go wrong with structure/parameter learning. I need to think about how to do this.

3) Allow users to log into BNW to easily save and return to networks? Currently, there is the option of using the network ID to return to the network. Is this something that we should keep long term?

4) Update structure learning code (parallelize, investigate other potential structure learning options).
