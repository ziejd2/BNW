1) Add some type of cross-validation. I am working on this and should have something ready soon.

2) Improve interface for users with a known structure ("Make predictions using a known structure" on the BNW homepage).
It should be more clear what button needs to be clicked to go to the next step. It might be better to upload the data and structure files on the same page.
The related files are home_upload.php, upload_structure_file.php, and net_structure.php.

3) Improve look when viewing additional files. 
Specifically, I am referring to data available in "View uploaded variabels and data", "Display structure matrix", and "View parameters". The related files are input_check.php, matrix.php, and parameter_display.php, respectively.

4) Add additional image of the network model that displays only the node names.
This could be the first visualization of the network that is displayed after structure learning. 
A couple of desired features: nodes that can be dragged and the potential to export a high quality image.
There would be a button somewhere with something like: "Make predictions with network" that would take users to current network visualization.
This would be viewed before layout.php.

5) Allow users to log into BNW to easily save and return to networks.

6) Add more informative error messages.

7) Improve security for uploaded files.

8) Parallelize the structure learning code.
